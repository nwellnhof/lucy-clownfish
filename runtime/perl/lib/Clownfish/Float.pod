=head1 NAME

Clownfish::Float - Immutable double precision floating point number.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $float = Clownfish::Float->new(2.5);
    my $value = $float->get_value;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 new

    my $float = Clownfish::Float->new($value);

Create a Float containing the passed-in value.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_value

    $float->get_value();

Return the value of the Float.

=head2 to_i64

    $float->to_i64();

Convert the Float to an integer, truncating toward zero.  Throw an
exception if the value is out of the range of an C<int64_t>.

=head2 compare_to

    $float->compare_to($other);

Indicate whether one number is less than, equal to, or greater than
another.  Throws an exception if C<other> is neither a Float nor an
Integer.

Returns: 0 if the numbers are equal, a negative number if C<self> is
less than C<other>, and a positive number if C<self> is greater than
C<other>.

=head2 clone
